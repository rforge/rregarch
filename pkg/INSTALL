The package requires to be linked to the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for
the purpose of numerical computations. We developed two ways to operate
the link:
	- Linking to the R-embedded GSL (by default)
	- Linking to an external GSL
		- On Linux OS
			- Install the GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) so that it
			  appears in the path.
			  e.g. with Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libgsl0ldbl libgsl0-dev
			- Change the variable EXT_GSL to 'True' in src/Makevars.
			- Proceed to the normal installation.
		- On Windows OS
			- Download the GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for your
			  architecture (both for i386 and x64 if you have a 64-bit
			  architecture).
			- Specify the path to the library in the environment variable
			  LIB_GSL32 (and LIB_GSL64 for x64 architectures) with UNIX conventions.
			  e.g. LIB_GSL32 C:/Users/Franck/Documents/dev/PPMMF/gsl-1.15-dev-win32
			       LIB_GSL64 C:/Users/Franck/Documents/dev/PPMMF/gsl-1.15-dev-win64
			- Add to the environment variable PATH the path to the binaries of each
			  version of the library with Windows conventions.
			  e.g. C:\Users\Franck\Documents\dev\PPMMF\gsl-1.15-dev-win32\bin
			       C:\Users\Franck\Documents\dev\PPMMF\gsl-1.15-dev-win64\bin
			- Change the variable EXT_GSL to 'False' in src/Makevars.win.
			- Proceed to the normal installation.
